"""
Catastrophe Command agent — Act 2 of the DevConnect demo.

In Act 1 the operator pastes the data engineer's SQL into a SQL editor / psql
by hand. In Act 2 that same vetted SQL becomes the agent's toolbox: the
operator types a plain-English request ("reroute the stuck frozen orders, then
refund the open complaints") and this agent picks the right vetted action, runs
it, and summarizes the result.

This file is deliberately ONE self-contained, swappable unit:

- It owns only the *names* of vetted, pre-deployed SQL objects — NOT their SQL.
  The query bodies live with the deployment, so they ship and version with the
  bundle:
    * `warehouse` actions call UC SQL functions + one UC procedure in
      `{catalog}.ai`, created by stages/catastrophe_command.ipynb.
    * `lakebase` actions call Postgres functions in the app's Postgres `public`
      schema, created by the app's db.py on boot.
  The agent just references them by name (`SELECT * FROM ...fn()` /
  `CALL ...proc()`).
- It knows nothing about FastAPI or psycopg. SQL execution is *injected* as two
  callables (``warehouse_exec`` for the UC SQL warehouse, ``lakebase_exec`` for
  Lakebase Postgres), so replacing this file's "brain" never touches the app.
- The LLM never writes SQL — it only selects from the vetted actions, one
  OpenAI tool per deployed function/procedure.

Swap the whole agent by replacing this file and keeping ``Agent(warehouse_exec=,
lakebase_exec=, catalog=)`` / ``Agent.run(message, history)``.
