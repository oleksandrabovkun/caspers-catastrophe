-- 3-warehouse-estimate-revenue-at-risk
-- Replace your_catalog with the catalog you deployed.
--

-- Estimates revenue still at risk in the current demo run: open live orders
-- (from Lakebase CDF → lakebase.lb_orders_history) valued with
-- this city's historical average order value from orders.bronze_hist_orders.
-- Grouped by status × item kind (with ROLLUP totals).
--
-- Requires: Lakebase CDF into lb_orders_history (initializer: Catastrophe_Command).
