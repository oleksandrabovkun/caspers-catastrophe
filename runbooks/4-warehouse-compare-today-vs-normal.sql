-- 4-warehouse-compare-today-vs-normal
-- Catalog: find-replace `devconnect` if you deployed with another catalog name.
-- Or run once: USE CATALOG IDENTIFIER('your_catalog');
--
-- Compares this demo run against a normal day for the active city:
-- cancel %, disrupted % (stuck/rerouted), and average lateness. Live side
-- comes from Lakebase CDF (lb_orders_history); baseline from
-- orders.bronze_hist_orders (90-day avg).
--
-- Requires: Lakebase CDF into lb_orders_history (initializer: Catastrophe_Command).
