-- Eighty-six burger buns for the active city in one atomic transaction:
-- zero kitchen_inventory qty AND flip menu_availability off together.
-- Run the three blocks in order: 5a (before) → 5 (atomic write) → 5b (after).
-- After 5b, inconsistent_rows must be 0 (no dish still marked available
-- when stock is zero).
