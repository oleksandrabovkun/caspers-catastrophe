-- 2-lakebase-issue-fair-refund
-- Run on: Lakebase (databricks_postgres)
--
-- Issues goodwill refunds for open complaints in the active city's latest
-- session. Refund amount is derived from this city's 90-day historical
-- averages (lakebase.bronze_hist_refunds), with a cold-chain
-- uplift. Inserts refunds, resolves the matching complaints, and returns
-- the refunds sent.
